Originally taught at the 2020 RStudio Conference, it is a friendly intro to becoming a modern R user, full of tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, collaboration & reproducibility and written to be used as a reference, to teach, or as self-paced learning.\nTidy Data Illustrated Series by Horst & Lowndes is artwork to illustrate why tidy data is so powerful for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration.\nOcean Health Index\nThe Ocean Health Index is a scientific framework used to measure how healthy oceans are. I was an OHI science program lead from 2013-2019 and helped amplify our transformation to open data science.\nOur path to better science in less time using open data science tools by Lowndes et al. 2017 describes how our open data science tranformed our team’s approach to reproduciblity, collaboration, and communication.\nOHI Global Assessments are updated annually since 2012 with the best available data and knowledge.\nOpen communities\nI have built so much confidence from inclusive and welcoming open communities, who have been instrumental in my growth as an open science contributor.\nrOpenSci R package contributor\nRStudio collaborator\nCarpentries instructor\nEco-Data-Science co-founder\nRLadies Santa Barbara co-founder\nMozilla fellow\n\n\n\n",
